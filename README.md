## Leetcode Code submission instructions 
- Commit messages must be the Leetcode problem, so that includes the problem number and problem title. [Example](https://github.com/Coachable-Dev/coachable-student-github-template/commit/72aca819a24053392f8ea2e93645233093f48450).
- Each problem should have at least one commit dedicated to it's addition. i.e. when fixing a problem or addressing a change, ensure that it's a seperate commit.
- Commits must be made to a separate branch (a feature branch), and not the main branch. Pull Requests (PRs) will be made to merge into the main branch. This will allow coaches to review your code and submissions. [Example](https://github.com/Coachable-Dev/coachable-student-github-template/commits/2024-11-13-submission).
- [**IMPORTANT**] [**WARNING**] When making a PR, ensure that the main branch that your are merging into belong to YOUR fork! Failure to do so will result in your PR getting ***rejected***, and you will have to remake it.
- PRs can consists of ***more than one problem*** and/or commit. However, ***each problem*** must include the leetcode problem number, loom link, and 2 - 3 word sentence summary within the PR message. Each problem must also be properly segmented with markdown, i.e. use seperators between each problem.

  - [**IMPORTANT**] Please include your assigned coach as the reviewer of your PR. If you don't, your coach will not grade or review your PR because they will miss it.
